Version 0.3
===========
	- minor code-cleanups
	- certain mechanism (anti-DOS, vector-resizing, sliding random
	  MACs) were documented and parameterized ; see src/parameters.h
	  for details
	- BUGFIX: broken signal-handling with dietlibc was fixed (dietlibc
	  sets SIG_DFL handler when entering a handler and -- in opposite to
	  glibc-2.3.1 -- does not restore this value to the handler set with
	  signal())
	- BUGFIX: stupid typo in vector-resize code which caused excessive
	  memory-consumption was fixed
	- testsuite was modified to give more determined results with
	  different bsort() implementations

	- build-fixes with RH 6.2
	- minor build-fixes

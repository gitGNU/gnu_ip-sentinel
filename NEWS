Version 0.6.2
=============

	NOTE: large parts of the project were touched to implement the new
	scheduler. Therefore, this version should be considered as
	experimental; when you encounter problems, it is recommended to go
	back to version 0.6 (after you reported those problems to me, of
	course).

	- added comprehensive 'simulate' testsuite-program which prints out
	  the ether/arp headers which will be generated by the real program
	
	- added '--llmac' option to configure MAC address used in linklevel-
	  headers when answering a request *from* intruders
	
	- FEATURE: ip-sentinel will answer arp-requests *from* intruders also.
	  This feature is disabled by default; you can enable it with the new
	  '--direction FROM/BOTH' cmdline option. Suggested by Mark ZZZ Smith.
	
	- FEATURE: changed from forked worker-processes to one worker
	  process with an own scheduler; this allows to increase the number
	  of pending ARP-replies significantly (formerly 40, now 511; see
	  src/parameters.h) without lowering system performance.
	
	- LEGACY BREAKAGE: enhanced/changed the log-format; when you want
	  the old one, go into Worker_printJob() in src/worker.c and change
	  the '#if 0' to '#if 1'. Note that this preprocessor directive can
	  and will disappear in future versions without explicit warnings.
	
	- FEATURE: a '--mac' option was added which allows to specify the
	  used mac-address; this option and the config-file understands
	  special values like '802.1d' or '802.3x'. This was suggested by
	  Mark ZZZ Smith.
	

Version 0.6
===========
	- FEATURE: support for numeric IP-ranges was added; suggested by
	  Jon Belanger
	- ship minit run-script in contrib/
	

Version 0.5
===========
	- BUGFIX: when having multiple interfaces in the host, ip-sentinel
	  listened on all ones instead only on this given on the
	  cmd-line. Thanks to Sergeev Sergey for reporting this.
	- enhanced RHL-initscript
	
Version 0.4
===========
	- logging was enhanced
	- anti-DOS limits were increased a little bit
	- FEATURE: it is allowed to specify a MAC for networks
	- build with RH 5.2 was fixed
	- a lot of minor cleanups

Version 0.3
===========
	- minor code-cleanups
	- certain mechanism (anti-DOS, vector-resizing, sliding random
	  MACs) were documented and parameterized ; see src/parameters.h
	  for details
	- BUGFIX: broken signal-handling with dietlibc was fixed (dietlibc
	  sets SIG_DFL handler when entering a handler and -- in opposite to
	  glibc-2.3.1 -- does not restore this value to the handler set with
	  signal())
	- BUGFIX: stupid typo in vector-resize code which caused excessive
	  memory-consumption was fixed
	- testsuite was modified to give more determined results with
	  different bsort() implementations

Version 0.2
===========
	- build-fixes with RH 6.2
	- minor build-fixes
	- documentation was added

Version 0.1
===========
	- initial release

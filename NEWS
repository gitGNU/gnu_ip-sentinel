Version 0.10
============
	
	- cleaned up the code; take reusable variants for the vector* and
	  fmt* functions

	- fixed compilation with dietlibc 0.26

	- LEGACY BREAKAGE: use tai64n timestamps for logging

	- LEGACY BREAKAGE: remove the complicated 'minit' run-script; it
	  is now a symlink and options must be configured in 'params'
	  manually


Version 0.9
===========

	- networks with '@MAC' statements are taking precedence over those
	  with the same netmask but without such statements. This makes it
	  possible to declare a pool of MACs within a network with dynamic
	  IP assignment. This change affects ambiguous configurations only
	  which would have an undefined behavior in previous versions.
	
	- BUGFIX: requests which are matching negated '@!MAC' statements,
	  are taking now precedence over later, more general matches
	  (reported by Sergeev Sergey)
	
	- added workarounds for a bug in dietlibc-0.24's printf()
	  function (affects testsuite only), and a gcc optimization bug
	  (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=110966)


Version 0.8
===========

	Default options/behavior have not been changed yet, but chances
	are high that they will become '--poision --mac 802.3x --direction
	BOTH'.
	
	- FEATURE: added '--poison' option which enables the generation of
	  ARP-replies for the ip of intruders when the intruder sends an
	  ARP-request. When using a negated '@!MAC' syntax, this MAC will be
	  used for the questionable IP. This option works only, when
	  '--direction FROM|BOTH' is used.  Inspired by ideas of Sergeev
	  Sergey.
	
	- BUGFIX: in '--direction FROM' mode, ignore 0.0.0.0 automatically
	  since it is used for duplicate address detection and/or
	  DHCPDISCOVER messages
	
	- made generated (tha,tpa) arp-parameters RFC826 compliant;
	  formerly, broadcast-values were used. It will require some testing
	  to see which version is more effective/working.

	- FEATURE: allowed to specify MAC addresses for source-ip
	  addresses.  This makes it possible to disturb intruders which are
	  using officially assigned IP addresses. This feature has the
	  syntax 'ip[/mask][@mac]' and takes only effect on packages coming
	  *from* intruders. Inspired by Mark Pierce.

	
Version 0.7
===========

	NOTE: large parts of the project were touched to implement the new
	scheduler. It has been tested extensively, but when you encounter
	problems, it is recommended to go back to version 0.6 (after you
	reported those problems to me, of course).

	Future version will probably default to '--mac 802.3x', '--llmac
	LOCAL' and '--direction BOTH'; but the current version uses still
	the legacy '--mac RANDOM' and '--direction TO' defaults.

	- added comprehensive 'simulate' testsuite-program which prints out
	  the ether/arp headers which would be generated by the real program
	
	- added '--llmac' option to configure MAC address used in linklevel-
	  headers when answering a request *from* intruders
	
	- FEATURE: ip-sentinel will answer arp-requests *from* intruders also.
	  This feature is disabled by default; you can enable it with the new
	  '--direction FROM/BOTH' cmdline option. Suggested by Mark ZZZ Smith.
	
	- FEATURE: changed from forked worker-processes to one worker
	  process with an own scheduler; this allows to increase the number
	  of pending ARP-replies significantly (formerly 40, now 511; see
	  src/parameters.h) without lowering system performance.
	
	- LEGACY BREAKAGE: enhanced/changed the log-format; when you want
	  the old one, go into Worker_printJob() in src/worker.c and change
	  the '#if 0' to '#if 1'. Note that this preprocessor directive can
	  and will disappear in future versions without explicit warnings.
	
	- FEATURE: a '--mac' option was added which allows to specify the
	  used mac-address; this option and the config-file understands
	  special values like '802.1d' or '802.3x'. This was suggested by
	  Mark ZZZ Smith.
	

Version 0.6
===========
	- FEATURE: support for numeric IP-ranges was added; suggested by
	  Jon Belanger
	- ship minit run-script in contrib/
	

Version 0.5
===========
	- BUGFIX: when having multiple interfaces in the host, ip-sentinel
	  listened on all ones instead only on this given on the
	  cmd-line. Thanks to Sergeev Sergey for reporting this.
	- enhanced RHL-initscript
	
Version 0.4
===========
	- logging was enhanced
	- anti-DOS limits were increased a little bit
	- FEATURE: it is allowed to specify a MAC for networks
	- build with RH 5.2 was fixed
	- a lot of minor cleanups

Version 0.3
===========
	- minor code-cleanups
	- certain mechanism (anti-DOS, vector-resizing, sliding random
	  MACs) were documented and parameterized ; see src/parameters.h
	  for details
	- BUGFIX: broken signal-handling with dietlibc was fixed (dietlibc
	  sets SIG_DFL handler when entering a handler and -- in opposite to
	  glibc-2.3.1 -- does not restore this value to the handler set with
	  signal())
	- BUGFIX: stupid typo in vector-resize code which caused excessive
	  memory-consumption was fixed
	- testsuite was modified to give more determined results with
	  different bsort() implementations

Version 0.2
===========
	- build-fixes with RH 6.2
	- minor build-fixes
	- documentation was added

Version 0.1
===========
	- initial release
